# Overview

The next chapters explain how the pipeline works. The main focus here is on the data flow and which methods are used. 
The procedure for a modeling project is also described.

The complete overview of the FRET assisted modeling pipeline divided into the areas of modeling, MD simulation, 
FRET measurements and comparison to experiments. Colors and shapes of the elements shown in the simplified flowchart 
indicate different methods and inputs and outputs.
