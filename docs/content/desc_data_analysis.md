## Creating distance and ùúÖ<sup>2</sup> distributions

To generate a FRET distribution, it is necessary to have a trajectory of dye distances and the orientations between 
the transition dipole moments of the dyes {cite}`Steffen.2021,Hoefling.2013`. This information can be obtained using the two previously created 
trajectories. One trajectory is used for determining the ACV along the MD trajectory with a constant ùúÖ<sup>2</sup>, while the 
other trajectory directly provides the dye distances and dipole coordinates. In the pipeline, parameters can be defined 
which include the name of the simulation and the atom IDs of the dye midpoint and dipole atoms.

### Determining distance and ùúÖ<sup>2</sup> from ACV calculation:

The first step involves loading the trajectory using mdtraj, which requires the xtc and pdb files of the trajectory. 
The parameters necessary for the ACV calculation is shown [here](content:parameter:dyes). Additionally, the atom IDs 
of the attachment points, which can be extracted from the PDB file, need to be specified. Utilizing the defined dye 
parameters and the parsed trajectory, the ACV can be computed using the `fretraj.cloud.pipeline_frames()` function. 
It is crucial to specify the desired calculation step width. For instance, in a 1 ¬µs simulation, it is recommended 
to calculate one ACV per 100 ps. However, it should be noted that an increased number of ACVs will result in longer 
calculation times. The trajectory can be saved using `fretraj.cloud.save_obj()`. The `fretraj.cloud.Trajectory()` 
function generates a trajectory of average dye distances based on the ACV‚Äôs and a ùúÖ<sup>2</sup> value of 0.66 is assumed. 
This trajectory file is saved as *r_kappa.dat* in the MACV directory.

Methods for generating distance-ùúÖ<sup>2</sup> trajectories.

### Determining the distance and ùúÖ<sup>2</sup> values from explicit dye simulations 

To generate the ùúÖ<sup>2</sup>-distance files, the dye dipoles must be defined. This requires finding the atom IDs of the dipole 
atoms and the central carbon atom of the dyes, which can be obtained from the gro file of the trajectory. Using these 
atom IDs and the MDAnalysis package, the spatial coordinates of the atoms can be extracted from the trajectory. The 
function `get_rkappa_file_from_dyes()` can then calculate the ùúÖ<sup>2</sup> values based on these dipole coordinates and the 
distance between the central carbon atoms of the dyes. Only the atom coordinates need to be provided. The calculated 
data is saved in a file named *r_kappa.dat*, which can be subsequently utilized by the FRETraj Burst module.

## Burst calculations and data visualizations 

Once the distance and ùúÖ<sup>2</sup> trajectories have been generated, they can be processed using the Burst submodule of FRETtraj. 
This submodule allows for simulating long-time FRET experiments on MD trajectories of a microsecond timescale by 
sampling photon events. Several parameters need to be defined, which are categorized into Dyes, Sampling, FRET, 
Species, and Burst ([Burst Parameter](content:parameter:burst)).

In the Dyes category, experimental properties of the dyes and the experimental setup are defined, such as lifetime, 
quantum yield and detection efficiency. While these values cannot be obtained from the simulation, they are necessary 
for calculations of photophysical parameters like the anisotropy or FRET. 

The Sampling category defines parameters related to the burst simulation, including the number of bursts to be 
simulated, frames to skip at the beginning and end of the trajectory, and whether multiprocessing should be used for 
calculations.

The Species category allows for defining different groups of structures within an ensemble. Each species can be given 
a name, and the corresponding dipole coordinate files and *r_kappa.dat* files can be specified. Additionally, a 
probability can be assigned to each species, and multiple species can be defined using lists.

In the Burst category, the burst itself is defined. This includes specifying a burst size distribution using a Poisson 
distribution with upper and lower limits, as well as a lambda value ($\lambda$ = -2.3). The burst size distribution can 
also be obtained through experimental measurements and imported as a file with the option *burst_size_file*. Averaging 
can be performed within each species or across the entire ensemble.

Workflow for the simulation of FRET experiments from the distance-$\kappa^2$
```

With the above defined parameters, FRET distributions can be simulated using the `fretraj.burst.Experiment(parameter)` 
function, applicable to both MACV and explicit dye simulations. The resulting FRET distributions can be compared with 
each other. Functions have been developed to facilitate visualization of the calculated data. This includes comparing 
simulated FRET distributions from MD and MACV with experimental data, plotting histograms of dye distances calculated 
from MACV and explicit dye simulations, and generating trajectory histogram plots.

For MACV, the FRET efficiency can be plotted without sampling and compared with the initial FRET value of the static 
model before simulation, demonstrating the influence of RNA movement on the FRET efficiency. Finally, the dynamic 
structural model should be compared by the user with experimental data, and the quality of the model in relation to the 
experiment is subject to user interpretation. If the model does not match the experiment, a feedback loop can lead back 
to the knowledge-based modeling approach with PyMOL.
