# The Project

This project combines different tools for modeling and simulation of RNA structures. 
Furthermore, functionalities were developed to efficiently analyze MD trajectories of 
labeled RNA. Here, the simulation of FRET experiments plays an essential role. 
Using the pipeline described here, RNA structures can be modeled and evaluated using 
smFRET experimental data.Fig
