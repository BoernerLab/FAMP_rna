Despite its direct biomedical significance, the architecture of the human telomerase complex remains unknown. Generating homogeneous telomerase samples has presented a significant barrier to developing improved structural models. Here we pair single-molecule F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements with Rosetta modeling to map the conformations of the essential telomerase RNA core domain within the active ribonucleoprotein. FRET-guided modeling places the essential pseudoknot fold distal to the active site on a protein surface comprising the C-terminal element, a domain that shares structural homology with canonical polymerase thumb domains. An independently solved medium-resolution structure of Tetrahymena telomerase provides a blind test of our modeling methodology and sheds light on the structural homology of this domain across diverse organisms. Our smFRET-Rosetta models reveal nanometer-scale rearrangements within the RNA core domain during catalysis. Taken together, our FRET data and pseudoatomic molecular models permit us to propose a possible mechanism for how RNA core domain rearrangement is coupled to template hybrid elongation.},

 abstract = {Analysis of the 2.4-A resolution crystal structure of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui reveals the existence of an abundant and ubiquitous structural motif that stabilizes RNA tertiary and quaternary structures. This motif is termed the A-minor motif, because it involves the insertion of the smooth, minor groove edges of adenines into the minor groove of neighboring helices, preferentially at C-G base pairs, where they form hydrogen bonds with one or both of the 2' OHs of those pairs. A-minor motifs stabilize contacts between RNA helices, interactions between loops and helices, and the conformations of junctions and tight turns. The interactions between the 3' terminal adenine of tRNAs bound in either the A site or the P site with 23S rRNA are examples of functionally significant A-minor interactions. The A-minor motif is by far the most abundant tertiary structure interaction in the large ribosomal subunit; 186 adenines in 23S and 5S rRNA participate, 68 of which are conserved. It may prove to be the universally most important long-range interaction in large RNA structures.},

In PIE, multiple excitation sources are interleaved such that the fluorescence emission generated from one pulse is complete before the next excitation pulse arrives. Hence, the excitation source for each detected photon is known. Typical repetition rates used for PIE are between approximately 1 and 50 MHz. PIE has many applications in various fluorescence methods. Using PIE, dual-color measurements can be performed with a single detector. In fluorescence imaging with multicolor detection, spectral cross talk can be removed, improving the contrast of the image. Using PIE with FCCS, we can eliminate spectral cross talk, making the method sensitive to weaker interactions. FCCS measurements with complexes that undergo FRET can be analyzed quantitatively. Under specific conditions, the FRET efficiency can be determined directly from the amplitude of the measured correlation functions without any calibration factors. We also show the application of PIE to spFRET measurements, where complexes that have low FRET efficiency can be distinguished from those that do not have an active acceptor.},

@article{Lorenz.2011,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Secondary structure forms an important intermediate level of description of nucleic acids that encapsulates the dominating part of the folding energy, is often well conserved in evolution, and is routinely used as a basis to explain experimental findings. Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters, exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used to compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as thermodynamic properties.

RESULTS

The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format. Updates were implemented without compromising the computational efficiency of the core algorithms and ensuring compatibility with earlier versions.

The ViennaRNA Package 2.0, supporting concurrent computations via OpenMP, can be downloaded from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA.},

As a result, the folding and dynamics of RNA and DNA and their complexes with proteins and with each other cannot be understood without a reasonably sophisticated appreciation of these ions' electrostatic interactions. However, the underlying behavior of the ion atmosphere follows physical rules that are distinct from the rules of site binding that biochemists are most familiar and comfortable with. The main goal of this review is to familiarize nucleic acid experimentalists with the physical concepts that underlie nucleic acid-ion interactions. Throughout, we provide practical strategies for interpreting and analyzing nucleic acid experiments that avoid pitfalls from oversimplified or incorrect models. We briefly review the status of theories that predict or simulate nucleic acid-ion interactions and experiments that test these theories. Finally, we describe opportunities for going beyond phenomenological fits to a next-generation, truly predictive understanding of nucleic acid-ion interactions.},

To provide a comprehensive comparison of the accuracy of PELDOR/DEER and smFRET, we use a library of double cysteine variants of four proteins that undergo large-scale conformational changes upon ligand binding. With either method, we use established standard experimental protocols and data analysis routines to determine inter-probe distances in the presence and absence of ligands. The results are compared to distance predictions from structural models. Despite an overall satisfying and similar distance accuracy, some inconsistencies are identified, which we attribute to the use of cryoprotectants for PELDOR/DEER and label-protein interactions for smFRET. This large-scale cross-validation of PELDOR/DEER and smFRET highlights the strengths, weaknesses, and synergies of these two important and complementary tools in integrative structural biology.},

The rapidly growing number of three-dimensional RNA structures at atomic resolution requires that databases contain the annotation of such base pairs. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature was proposed recently in which RNA base pairs were classified by the base edges participating in the interaction (Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen/CH or sugar edge) and the orientation of the glycosidic bonds relative to the hydrogen bonds (cis or trans). Twelve basic geometric families were identified and all 12 have been observed in crystal structures. For each base pairing family, we present here the 4 x 4 'isostericity matrices' summarizing the geometric relationships between the 16 pairwise combinations of the four standard bases, A, C, G and U. Whenever available, a representative example of each observed base pair from X-ray crystal structures (3.0 A resolution or better) is provided or, otherwise, theoretically plausible models. This format makes apparent the recurrent geometric patterns that are observed and helps identify isosteric pairs that co-vary or interchange in sequences of homologous molecules while maintaining conserved three-dimensional motifs.},

 abstract = {Non-Watson-Crick base pairs mediate specific interactions responsible for RNA-RNA self-assembly and RNA-protein recognition. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature with well-defined and nonoverlapping parameters is needed to communicate concisely structural information about RNA base pairs. The definitions should reflect underlying molecular structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation, classification, and comparison of new RNA structures. We propose a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge, hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three distinct edges: the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge, and the Sugar edge (which includes the 2'-OH and which has also been referred to as the Shallow-groove edge). Bases can interact in either of two orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types with at least two H bonds connecting the bases. For each geometric type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced. High-resolution examples of 11 of the 12 geometries are presently available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl or amino group of one base directly contacts the edge of a second base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates the recognition of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry, and thus facilitates the recognition of recurrent three-dimensional motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions are proposed for displaying non-Watson-Crick interactions on a secondary structure diagram. The utility of the classification in homology modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.},

ALEX yields accurate FRET independent of instrumental factors, such as excitation intensity or detector alignment. Using DNA fragments, we showed that ALEX-based distances agree well with predictions from a cylindrical model of DNA; ALEX-based distances fit better to theory than distances obtained at the ensemble level. Distance measurements within transcription complexes agreed well with ensemble-FRET measurements, and with structural models based on ensemble-FRET and x-ray crystallography. ALEX can benefit structural analysis of biomolecules, especially when such molecules are inaccessible to conventional structural methods due to heterogeneity or transient nature.},

 abstract = {MOTIVATION

The secondary structure of RNA is integral to the variety of functions it carries out in the cell and its depiction allows researchers to develop hypotheses about which nucleotides and base pairs are functionally relevant. Current approaches to visualizing secondary structure provide an adequate platform for the conversion of static text-based representations to 2D images, but are limited in their offer of interactivity as well as their ability to display larger structures, multiple structures and pseudoknotted structures.

RESULTS

In this article, we present forna, a web-based tool for displaying RNA secondary structure which allows users to easily convert sequences and secondary structures to clean, concise and customizable visualizations. It supports, among other features, the simultaneous visualization of multiple structures, the display of pseudoknotted structures, the interactive editing of the displayed structures, and the automatic generation of secondary structure diagrams from PDB files. It requires no software installation apart from a modern web browser.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION

The web interface of forna is available at http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/forna while the source code is available on github at www.github.com/pkerpedjiev/forna.

This was performed by labeling biomolecules with fluorophores that serve as donor-acceptor pairs for F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer, and by using alternating-laser excitation to excite directly both donors and acceptors present in single diffusing molecules. Emissions were reduced to the distance-dependent ratio E, and a distance-independent, stoichiometry-based ratio S. Histograms of E and S sorted species based on the conformation and association status of each species. S was sensitive to the stoichiometry and relative brightness of fluorophores in single molecules, observables that can monitor oligomerization and local-environment changes, respectively. FAMS permits equilibrium and kinetic analysis of macromolecule-ligand interactions; this was validated by measuring equilibrium and kinetic dissociation constants for the interaction of Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein with DNA. FAMS is a general platform for ratiometric measurements that report on structure, dynamics, stoichiometries, environment, and interactions of diffusing or immobilized molecules, thus enabling detailed mechanistic studies and ultrasensitive diagnostics.},

@article{Levitus.2011,
 abstract = {The breakthroughs in single molecule spectroscopy of the last decade and the recent advances in super resolution microscopy have boosted the popularity of cyanine dyes in biophysical research. These applications have motivated the investigation of the reactions and relaxation processes that cyanines undergo in their electronically excited states. Studies show that the triplet state is a key intermediate in the photochemical reactions that limit the photostability of cyanine dyes. The removal of oxygen greatly reduces photobleaching, but induces rapid intensity fluctuations (blinking). The existence of non-fluorescent states lasting from milliseconds to seconds was early identified as a limitation in single-molecule spectroscopy and a potential source of artifacts. Recent studies demonstrate that a combination of oxidizing and reducing agents is the most efficient way of guaranteeing that the ground state is recovered rapidly and efficiently. Thiol-containing reducing agents have been identified as the source of long-lived dark states in some cyanines that can be photochemically switched back to the emissive state. The mechanism of this process is the reversible addition of the thiol-containing compound to a double bond in the polymethine chain resulting in a non-fluorescent molecule. This process can be reverted by irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Another mechanism that leads to non-fluorescent states in cyanine dyes is cis-trans isomerization from the singlet-excited state. This process, which competes with fluorescence, involves the rotation of one-half of the molecule with respect to the other with an efficiency that depends strongly on steric effects. The efficiency of fluorescence of most cyanine dyes has been shown to depend dramatically on their molecular environment within the biomolecule. For example, the fluorescence quantum yield of Cy3 linked covalently to DNA depends on the type of linkage used for attachment, DNA sequence and secondary structure. Cyanines linked to the DNA termini have been shown to be mostly stacked at the end of the helix, while cyanines linked to the DNA internally are believed to partially bind to the minor or major grooves. These interactions not only affect the photophysical properties of the probes but also create a large uncertainty in their orientation.},

 abstract = {F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements are widely used to investigate (bio)molecular interactions or/and association. FRET efficiencies, the primary data obtained from this method, give, in combination with the common assumption of isotropic chromophore orientation, detailed insight into the lengthscale of molecular phenomena. This study illustrates the application of a FRET efficiency restraint during classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of a mutant mastoparan X peptide in either water or 7 M aqueous urea. The restraint forces acting on the donor and acceptor chromophores ensure that the sampled peptide configurational ensemble satisfies the experimental primary data by modifying interchromophore separation and chromophore transition dipole moment orientations. By means of a conformational cluster analysis, it is seen that indeed different configurational ensembles may be sampled without and with application of the restraint. In particular, while the FRET efficiency and interchromophore distances monitored in an unrestrained simulation may differ from the experimentally-determined values, they can be brought in agreement with experimental data through usage of the FRET efficiency restraining potential. Furthermore, the present results suggest that the assumption of isotropic chromophore orientation is not always justified. The FRET efficiency restraint allows the generation of configurational ensembles that may not be accessible with unrestrained simulations, and thereby supports a meaningful interpretation of experimental FRET results in terms of the underlying molecular degrees of freedom. Thus, it offers an additional tool to connect the realms of computer and wet-lab experimentation.},

 abstract = {Fluorescence provides a mechanism for achieving contrast in biological imaging that enables investigations of molecular structure, dynamics, and function at high spatial and temporal resolution. Small-molecule organic fluorophores have proven essential for such efforts and are widely used in advanced applications such as single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy. Yet, organic fluorophores, like all fluorescent species, exhibit instabilities in their emission characteristics, including blinking and photobleaching that limit their utility and performance. Here, we review the photophysics and photochemistry of organic fluorophores as they pertain to mitigating such instabilities, with a specific focus on the development of stabilized fluorophores through derivatization. Self-healing organic fluorophores, wherein the triplet state is intramolecularly quenched by a covalently attached protective agent, exhibit markedly improved photostabilities. We discuss the potential for further enhancements towards the goal of developing {\textquotedbl}ultra-stable{\textquotedbl} fluorophores spanning the visible spectrum and how such fluorophores are likely to impact the future of single-molecule research.},

 abstract = {We report a reparameterization of the glycosidic torsion \textgreek{q} of the Cornell et al. AMBER force field for RNA, \textgreek{q}(OL). The parameters remove destabilization of the anti region found in the ff99 force field and thus prevent formation of spurious ladder-like structural distortions in RNA simulations. They also improve the description of the syn region and the syn-anti balance as well as enhance MD simulations of various RNA structures. Although \textgreek{q}(OL) can be combined with both ff99 and ff99bsc0, we recommend the latter. We do not recommend using \textgreek{q}(OL) for B-DNA because it does not improve upon ff99bsc0 for canonical structures. However, it might be useful in simulations of DNA molecules containing syn nucleotides. Our parametrization is based on high-level QM calculations and differs from conventional parametrization approaches in that it incorporates some previously neglected solvation-related effects (which appear to be essential for obtaining correct anti/high-anti balance). Our \textgreek{q}(OL) force field is compared with several previous glycosidic torsion parametrizations.},

 abstract = {Ribosome biogenesis is a highly complex process in eukaryotes, involving temporally and spatially regulated ribosomal protein (r-protein) binding and ribosomal RNA remodelling events in the nucleolus, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Hundreds of assembly factors, organized into sequential functional groups, facilitate and guide the maturation process into productive assembly branches in and across different cellular compartments. However, the precise mechanisms by which these assembly factors function are largely unknown. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to characterize the structures of yeast nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles affinity-purified using the epitope-tagged assembly factor Nog2. Our data pinpoint the locations and determine the structures of over 20 assembly factors, which are enriched in two areas: an arc region extending from the central protuberance to the polypeptide tunnel exit, and the domain including the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) that separates 5.8S and 25S ribosomal RNAs. In particular, two regulatory GTPases, Nog2 and Nog1, act as hub proteins to interact with multiple, distant assembly factors and functional ribosomal RNA elements, manifesting their critical roles in structural remodelling checkpoints and nuclear export. Moreover, our snapshots of compositionally and structurally different pre-60S intermediates provide essential mechanistic details for three major remodelling events before nuclear export: rotation of the 5S ribonucleoprotein, construction of the active centre and ITS2 removal. The rich structural information in our structures provides a framework to dissect molecular roles of diverse assembly factors in eukaryotic ribosome assembly.},

Here, we benchmark FARFAR2, an algorithm integrating RNA-Puzzle-inspired innovations with updated fragment libraries and helix modeling. In 16 of 21 RNA-Puzzles revisited without experimental data or expert intervention, FARFAR2 recovers native-like structures more accurate than models submitted during the RNA-Puzzles trials. Remaining bottlenecks include conformational sampling for {\textgreater}80-nucleotide problems and scoring function limitations more generally. Supporting these conclusions, preregistered blind models for adenovirus VA-I RNA and five riboswitch complexes predicted native-like folds with 3- to 14 {\AA} root-mean-square deviation accuracies.

RNA has four similar monomer units, whereas proteins have 20 very different residues. The folding of RNA is hierarchical in that secondary structure is much more stable than tertiary folding. In RNA the two levels of folding (secondary and tertiary) can be experimentally separated by the presence or absence of Mg2+. Secondary structure can be predicted successfully from experimental thermodynamic data on secondary structure elements: helices, loops, and bulges. Tertiary interactions can then be added without much distortion of the secondary structure. These observations suggest a folding algorithm to predict the structure of an RNA from its sequence. However, to solve the RNA folding problem one needs thermodynamic data on tertiary structure interactions, and identification and characterization of metal-ion binding sites. These data, together with force versus extension measurements on single RNA molecules, should provide the information necessary to test and refine the proposed algorithm.},

Due to the difficulties in experimentally assessing structures of large RNAs, there is currently great demand for new high-resolution structure prediction methods. We present the novel method for the fully automated prediction of RNA 3D structures from a user-defined secondary structure. The concept is founded on the machine translation system. The translation engine operates on the RNA FRABASE database tailored to the dictionary relating the RNA secondary structure and tertiary structure elements. The translation algorithm is very fast. Initial 3D structure is composed in a range of seconds on a single processor. The method assures the prediction of large RNA 3D structures of high quality. Our approach needs neither structural templates nor RNA sequence alignment, required for comparative methods. This enables the building of unresolved yet native and artificial RNA structures. The method is implemented in a publicly available, user-friendly server RNAComposer. It works in an interactive mode and a batch mode. The batch mode is designed for large-scale modelling and accepts atomic distance restraints. Presently, the server is set to build RNA structures of up to 500 residues.},

By single-molecule FRET, we explore the binding kinetics of the most important, structurally conserved contact, the exon and intron binding site 1 (EBS1/IBS1). A comparison of RNA-RNA and RNA-DNA hybrid contacts identifies transient metal ion binding as a major source of kinetic heterogeneity which typically appears in the form of degenerate FRET states. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest a structural link between heterogeneity and the sugar conformation at the exon-intron binding interface. While Mg2+ ions lock the exon in place and give rise to long dwell times in the exon bound FRET state, sugar puckering alleviates this structural rigidity and likely promotes exon release. The interplay of sugar puckering and metal ion coordination may be an important mechanism to balance binding affinities of RNA and DNA interactions in general.},

Photophysical parameters including the fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield and dynamic anisotropy are monitored as a function of the nucleic acid composition, conformation, and metal ion abundance. Occasional excursions to a non-fluorescent cis-state hint at the remarkable sensitivity of carbocyanines to their local environment. Comparison of time-correlated single photon experiments with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the propensity of photoisomerization is dictated by sterical constraints imposed on the fluorophore.

The application of such simulations to RNA structures, however, has proven more challenging, due in large part to the fact that the physical models ({\textquotedbl}force fields{\textquotedbl}) available for MD simulations of RNA molecules are substantially less accurate in many respects than those currently available for proteins. Here, we introduce an extensive revision of a widely used RNA force field in which the parameters have been modified, based on quantum mechanical calculations and existing experimental information, to more accurately reflect the fundamental forces that stabilize RNA structures. We evaluate these revised parameters through long-timescale MD simulations of a set of RNA molecules that covers a wide range of structural complexity, including single-stranded RNAs, RNA duplexes, RNA hairpins, and riboswitches. The structural and thermodynamic properties measured in these simulations exhibited dramatically improved agreement with experimentally determined values. Based on the comparisons we performed, this RNA force field appears to achieve a level of accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art protein force fields, thus significantly advancing the utility of MD simulation as a tool for elucidating the structural dynamics and function of RNA molecules and RNA-containing biological assemblies.},

 abstract = {The investigation and understanding of the folding mechanism of multidomain proteins is still a challenge in structural biology. The use of single-molecule F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer offers a unique tool to map conformational changes within the protein structure. Here, we present a study following denaturant-induced unfolding transitions of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase by mapping several inter- and intradomain distances of this two-domain protein, exhibiting a quite heterogeneous behavior. On the one hand, the development of the interdomain distance during the unfolding transition suggests a classical two-state unfolding behavior. On the other hand, the behavior of some intradomain distances indicates the formation of a compact and transient molten globule intermediate state. Furthermore, different intradomain distances measured within the same domain show pronounced differences in their unfolding behavior, underlining the fact that the choice of dye attachment positions within the polypeptide chain has a substantial impact on which unfolding properties are observed by single-molecule F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer measurements. Our results suggest that, to fully characterize the complex folding and unfolding mechanism of multidomain proteins, it is necessary to monitor multiple intra- and interdomain distances because a single reporter can lead to a misleading, partial, or oversimplified interpretation.},

 abstract = {Molecular simulation is a valuable and complementary tool that may assist with the interpretation of single-molecule F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, if the energy function is of sufficiently high quality. Here we present force-field parameters for one of the most common pairs of chromophores used in experiments, AlexaFluor 488 and 594. From microsecond molecular-dynamics simulations, we are able to recover both experimentally determined equilibrium constants and association/dissociation rates of the chromophores with free tryptophan, as well as the decay of fluorescence anisotropy of a labeled protein. We find that it is particularly important to obtain a correct balance of solute-water interactions in~the simulations in order to faithfully capture the experimental anisotropy decays, which provide a sensitive benchmark for fluorophore mobility. Lastly, by a combination of experiment and simulation, we address a potential complication in the interpretation of experiments on polyproline, used as a molecular ruler for FRET experiments, namely the potential association of one of the chromophores with the polyproline helix. Under conditions where simulations accurately capture the fluorescence anisotropy decay, we find at most a modest, transient population of conformations in which the chromophores associate with the polyproline. Explicit calculation of FRET transfer efficiencies for short polyprolines yields results in good agreement with experiment. These results illustrate the potential power of a combination of molecular simulation and experiment in quantifying biomolecular dynamics.},

 abstract = {The GAAA tetraloop-receptor motif is a commonly occurring tertiary interaction in RNA. This motif usually occurs in combination with other tertiary interactions in complex RNA structures. Thus, it is difficult to measure directly the contribution that a single GAAA tetraloop-receptor interaction makes to the folding properties of a RNA. To investigate the kinetics and thermodynamics for the isolated interaction, a GAAA tetraloop domain and receptor domain were connected by a single-stranded A(7) linker. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were used to probe intramolecular docking of the GAAA tetraloop and receptor. Docking was induced using a variety of metal ions, where the charge of the ion was the most important factor in determining the concentration of the ion required to promote docking [Co(NH(3))(6)(3+)] {\textless} [Ca(2+)], [Mg(2+)], [Mn(2+)] {\textless} [Na(+)], [K(+)]. Analysis of metal ion cooperativity yielded Hill coefficients of approximately 2 for Na(+)- or K(+)-dependent docking versus approximately 1 for the divalent ions and Co(NH(3))(6)(3+). Ensemble stopped-flow FRET kinetic measurements yielded an apparent activation energy of 12.7 kcal/mol for GAAA tetraloop-receptor docking. RNA constructs with U(7) and A(14) single-stranded linkers were investigated by single-molecule and ensemble FRET techniques to determine how linker length and composition affect docking. These studies showed that the single-stranded region functions primarily as a flexible tether. Inhibition of docking by oligonucleotides complementary to the linker was also investigated. The influence of flexible versus rigid linkers on GAAA tetraloop-receptor docking is discussed.},

In this study, a previously described 35-mer E2-specific aptamer was used to analyse the binding characteristics between E2 and the aptamer with a MD simulation in an aqueous medium. Because there is no 3D structure information available for this aptamer, it was modeled using coarse-grained modeling method. The E2 ligand was positioned inside a potential binding area of the predicted aptamer structure, the complex was used for an 25 ns MD simulation, and the interactions were examined for each time step. We identified E2-specific bases within the interior loop of the aptamer and also demonstrated the influence of frequently underestimated water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The study contributes to the understanding of the behavior of ligands binding with aptamer structure in an aqueous solution. The developed workflow allows generating and examining further appealing ligand-aptamer complexes.},

 abstract = {F{\"o}rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments probe molecular distances via distance dependent energy transfer from an excited donor dye to an acceptor dye. Single molecule experiments not only probe average distances, but also distance distributions or even fluctuations, and thus provide a powerful tool to study biomolecular structure and dynamics. However, the measured energy transfer efficiency depends not only on the distance between the dyes, but also on their mutual orientation, which is typically inaccessible to experiments. Thus, assumptions on the orientation distributions and averages are usually made, limiting the accuracy of the distance distributions extracted from FRET experiments. Here, we demonstrate that by combining single molecule FRET experiments with the mutual dye orientation statistics obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, improved estimates of distances and distributions are obtained. From the simulated time-dependent mutual orientations, FRET efficiencies are calculated and the full statistics of individual photon absorption, energy transfer, and photon emission events is obtained from subsequent Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the FRET kinetics. All recorded emission events are collected to bursts from which efficiency distributions are calculated in close resemblance to the actual FRET experiment, taking shot noise fully into account. Using polyproline chains with attached Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 dyes as a test system, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by direct comparison to experimental data. We identified cis-isomers and different static local environments as sources of the experimentally observed heterogeneity. Reconstructions of distance distributions from experimental data at different levels of theory demonstrate how the respective underlying assumptions and approximations affect the obtained accuracy. Our results show that dye fluctuations obtained from MD simulations, combined with MC single photon kinetics, provide a versatile tool to improve the accuracy of distance distributions that can be extracted from measured single molecule FRET efficiencies.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in single molecule fluorescence experiments and theory allow a direct comparison and improved interpretation of experiment and simulation. To this end, force fields for a larger number of dyes are required which are compatible with and can be integrated into existing biomolecular force fields. Here, we developed, characterized, and implemented AMBER-DYES, a modular fluorescent label force field, for a set of 22 fluorescent dyes and their linkers from the Alexa, Atto, and Cy families, which are in common use for single molecule spectroscopy experiments. The force field is compatible with the AMBER protein force fields and the GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation program. The high electronic polarizability of the delocalized \textgreek{p}-electron orbitals, as found in many fluorescent dyes, poses a particular challenge to point charge based force fields such as AMBER. To quantify the charge fluctuations due to the electronic polarizability, we simulated the 22 dyes in explicit solvent and sampled the charge fluctuations using QM/MM simulations at the B3LYP/6-31G*//TIP3P level of theory. The analysis of the simulations enabled us to derive ensemble fitted RESP charges from the solvated charge distributions of multiple trajectories. We observed broad, single peaked charge distributions for the conjugated ring atoms with well-defined mean values. The charge fitting procedure was validated against published charges of the dyelike amino acid tryptophan, which showed good agreement with existing tryptophan parameters from the AMBER, CHARMM, and OPLS force field families. A principal component analysis of the charge fluctuations revealed that a small number of collective coordinates suffices to describe most of the in-plane dye polarizability. The AMBER-DYES force field allows the rapid preparation of all atom molecular dynamics simulations of fluorescent systems for state of the art multi microsecond trajectories.},

This article summarizes the energetic factors that must be considered when ions interact with two different RNA environments. {\textquotedbl}Diffuse ions{\textquotedbl} accumulate near the RNA because of the RNA electrostatic field and remain largely hydrated. A {\textquotedbl}chelated{\textquotedbl} ion directly contacts a specific location on the RNA surface and is held in place by electrostatic forces. Energetic costs of ion chelation include displacement of some of the waters of hydration by the RNA surface and repulsion of diffuse ions. Methods are discussed for computing both the free energy of the set of diffuse ions associated with an RNA and the binding free energies of individual chelated ions. Such calculations quantitatively account for the effects of Mg(2+) on RNA stability where experimental data are available. An important conclusion is that diffuse ions are a major factor in the stabilization of RNA tertiary structures.},

@article{Fiore.2009,
 abstract = {RNA folding thermodynamics are crucial for structure prediction, which requires characterization of both enthalpic and entropic contributions of tertiary motifs to conformational stability. We explore the temperature dependence of RNA folding due to the ubiquitous GAAA tetraloop-receptor docking interaction, exploiting immobilized and freely diffusing single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) methods. The equilibrium constant for intramolecular docking is obtained as a function of temperature (T = 21-47 degrees C), from which a van't Hoff analysis yields the enthalpy (DeltaH degrees) and entropy (DeltaS degrees) of docking. Tetraloop-receptor docking is significantly exothermic and entropically unfavorable in 1 mM MgCl(2) and 100 mM NaCl, with excellent agreement between immobilized (DeltaH degrees = -17.4 +/- 1.6 kcal/mol, and DeltaS degrees = -56.2 +/- 5.4 cal mol(-1) K(-1)) and freely diffusing (DeltaH degrees = -17.2 +/- 1.6 kcal/mol, and DeltaS degrees = -55.9 +/- 5.2 cal mol(-1) K(-1)) species. Kinetic heterogeneity in the tetraloop-receptor construct is unaffected over the temperature range investigated, indicating a large energy barrier for interconversion between the actively docking and nondocking subpopulations. Formation of the tetraloop-receptor interaction can account for approximately 60{\%} of the DeltaH degrees and DeltaS degrees of P4-P6 domain folding in the Tetrahymena ribozyme, suggesting that it may act as a thermodynamic clamp for the domain. Comparison of the isolated tetraloop-receptor and other tertiary folding thermodynamics supports a theme that enthalpy- versus entropy-driven folding is determined by the number of hydrogen bonding and base stacking interactions.},

@article{Fiore.2012,
 abstract = {Mg(2+) is essential for the proper folding and function of RNA, though the effect of Mg(2+) concentration on the free energy, enthalpy, and entropy landscapes of RNA folding is unknown. This work exploits temperature-controlled single-molecule FRET methods to address the thermodynamics of RNA folding pathways by probing the intramolecular docking/undocking kinetics of the ubiquitous GAAA tetraloop-receptor tertiary interaction as a function of [Mg(2+)]. These measurements yield the barrier and standard state enthalpies, entropies, and free energies for an RNA tertiary transition, in particular, revealing the thermodynamic origin of [Mg(2+)]-facilitated folding. Surprisingly, these studies reveal that increasing [Mg(2+)] promotes tetraloop-receptor interaction by reducing the entropic barrier (-T\textgreek{D}S(++)(dock)) and the overall entropic penalty (-T\textgreek{D}S(+) (dock)) for docking, with essentially negligible effects on both the activation enthalpy (\textgreek{D}H(++)(dock)) and overall exothermicity (\textgreek{D}H(+)(dock)). These observations contrast with the conventional notion that increasing [Mg(2+)] facilitates folding by minimizing electrostatic repulsion of opposing RNA helices, which would incorrectly predict a decrease in \textgreek{D}H(++)(dock)) and \textgreek{D}H(+)(dock)) with [Mg(2+)]. Instead we propose that higher [Mg(2+)] can aid RNA folding by decreasing the entropic penalty of counterion uptake and by reducing disorder of the unfolded conformational ensemble.},

@article{Fiore.2012b,
 abstract = {For RNA to fold into compact, ordered structures, it must overcome electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged phosphate groups by counterion recruitment. A physical understanding of the counterion-assisted folding process requires addressing how cations kinetically and thermodynamically control the folding equilibrium for each tertiary interaction in a full-length RNA. In this work, single-molecule FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) techniques are exploited to isolate and explore the cation-concentration-dependent kinetics for formation of a ubiquitous RNA tertiary interaction, that is, the docking/undocking of a GAAA tetraloop with its 11-nt receptor. Rate constants for docking (k(dock)) and undocking (k(undock)) are obtained as a function of cation concentration, size, and valence, specifically for the series Na(+), K(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Co(NH(3))(6)(3+), and spermidine(3+). Increasing cation concentration acceleratesk(dock)dramatically but achieves only a slight decrease in k(undock). These results can be kinetically modeled using parallel cation-dependent and cation-independent docking pathways, which allows for isolation of the folding kinetics from the interaction energetics of the cations with the undocked and docked states, respectively. This analysis reveals a preferential interaction of the cations with the transition state and docked state as compared to the undocked RNA, with the ion-RNA interaction strength growing with cation valence. However, the corresponding number of cations that are taken up by the RNA upon folding decreases with charge density of the cation. The only exception to these behaviors is spermidine(3+), whose weaker influence on the docking equilibria with respect to Co(NH(3))(6)(3+) can be ascribed to steric effects preventing complete neutralization of the RNA phosphate groups.},

@article{Fiore.2008,
 abstract = {Proper assembly of RNA into catalytically active three-dimensional structures requires multiple tertiary binding interactions, individual characterization of which is crucial to a detailed understanding of global RNA folding. This work focuses on single-molecule fluorescence studies of freely diffusing RNA constructs that isolate the GAAA tetraloop-receptor tertiary interaction. Freely diffusing conformational dynamics are explored as a function of Mg(2+) and Na(+) concentration, both of which promote facile docking, but with 500-fold different affinities. Systematic shifts in mean fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency values and line widths with increasing [Na(+)] are observed for the undocked species and can be interpreted with a Debye model in terms of electrostatic relaxation and increased flexibility in the RNA. Furthermore, we identify a 34 +/- 2{\%} fraction of freely diffusing RNA constructs remaining undocked even at saturating [Mg(2+)] levels, which agrees quantitatively with the 32 +/- 1{\%} fraction previously reported for immobilized constructs. This verifies that the kinetic heterogeneity observed in the docking rates is not the result of surface tethering. Finally, the K(D) value and Hill coefficient for [Mg(2+)]-dependent docking decrease significantly for [Na(+)] = 25 mM vs. 125 mM, indicating Mg(2+) and Na(+) synergy in the RNA folding process.},
